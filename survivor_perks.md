## [Adrenaline](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Adrenaline>) 😷 💪

- Remove the Haste bonus and Exhausted status effect
  - Lowers the strength level by removing it's secondary effect. Also removes one of the stronger feast or famine aspects by making it impossible to use as an Unbreakable + Sprint Burst combo on it's own.


## [Aftercare](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Aftercare>) 📉 🗑️

- Once you are hooked, stop revealing the auras of the **2** longest revealed Survivor(s) *(was stop revealing all revealed Survivor(s))
  - Increases the consistency of the perk providing even more value in low-party-size situations.


## [Alert](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Alert>) 🗑️

- Trigger aura read on vault in addition to break and damage actions
  - Additional activation condition making it viable in more situations.

or

- Increased duration to **10 seconds** *(was 5 seconds)*
  - Numbers buff that extends the practical benefit of the perk, as previously nearly half the duration is simply showing the Survivor the killer's kick animation.


## [Any Means Necessary](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Any_Means_Necessary>) 📉 🗑️

- Permanently reveal the aura of dropped pallets, even once picked up
  - Minor side benefit as a reward for using the perk's primary purpose.


## [Apocalyptic Ingenuity](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Apocalyptic_Ingenuity>) 📉 🗑️

- Change activation condition to repairing a total of **40%** of a Generator *(was unlock/rummage two chests)*
  - Greatly increases it's viability for use throughout the match by removing the need to accomplish a side objective to activate your perk which in and of itself is effectively a side objective.
- Reduce rebuild time to **3 seconds** *(was 4)*
  - Slight numbers buff to an already weak perk, specifically without creating guaranteed re-stuns.


## [Appraisal](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Appraisal>) 📉 🗑️

- Increased action speed of unlocking in addition to rummaging
  - Makes the perk more universally useful when interacting with chests, lessening the imapct of completing a side-objective as required for the rest of the perk's functions.
- Increased action speed bonus to **60/80/100%** *(was 40/60/80%)*
  - Slight numbers buff increasing the speed benefit again to lessen the impact of going out of your way to complete a side objective.

and either:

- No longer limited to two rummages per chest
  - Removes the need to scour the map for multiple chests to get full value from your perk, again reducing the time spent on side-objectives.

or

- Gain **1 Token** every time you deplete an item
  - Makes the perk effectively renewable, allowing it to ensure you always (at least can) have an item throughout the trial.


## [Autodidact](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Autodidact>) 📉 🔬

- Allow gaining tokens from Self-Heal, only restricting the progression modifier to altruistic healing
  - Allows gaining altruistic benefits from Self-Healing, without being fundamentally broken with uber-fast Self-Healing, removing the bar of only gaining tokens via Altruistic healing for another niche improvement.
- Allow usage with Med-Kits
  - Straightforward removal of one of the perk downsides to increase it's overall viability and opportunities for synergy.
- Adjust skillcheck healing progress by token to: **0/10/20/30/40/60%** per stack *(was -15/0/15/30/45/60%)*
  - Slight numbers buff avoiding the awkward situation where the first Autodidact skill check could potentially cause a teammate's heal to be incomplete because of the -15% progress, removing an artifical downside aside from the inability to hit great skill checks.


## [Babysitter](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Babysitter>) 📉

- Suppress Grunts of Pain in addition to Scratch Marks and Pools of Blood
  - Secondary still-thematic effects that synergize well with the perks perfect while not making it [too powerful](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Babysitter#Patch_9.0.0).


## [Background Player](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Background_Player>) *🗑️ (for Exhaustion)*

- Change activation condition to pressing an Active Ability button while a Survivor is being carried.
  - Prevents accidental activations and allows more thoughtful gameplay for one of the less-used Exhaustion perks.

or

- Reduce Exhaustion duration to **5 seconds** *(was 20)*
  - Accidental activations are less punishing and makes synergy with other Exhaustion perks to be more viable.


## [Balanced Landing](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Balanced_Landing>) *🗑️ (for Exhaustion)*

- Separate stagger reduction from Exhaustion
  - Increases the consistency of a map-specific, low-use exhaustion perk across a variety maps, potentially opening up the doors to unqiue plays in and out of chase that are otherwise unachievable


## [Bardic Inspiration](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Bardic_Inspiration>) 📉 🗑️ 🔬

- Removed range limitation *(was 16 meters)*
  - Allows the perk to have a global rather than localized effect, making it somewhat an opposing counterpart to Prove Thyself
- Reduce cooldown to **52/44/36 seconds** *(was 110/100/90)*
  - Allows for the strategic gambling of getting a higher roll, without making getting a low roll instantly cause you to re-roll on repeat.
- Now increases skillcheck trigger chance by **0/1/2/3%** based on roll
  - Increases the overall strength of the perk, hopefully not too much.


## [Better Together](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Better_Together>) 📉 🗑️

- In addition to other Survivor(s) seeing the generator you are on, you also see the generator other Survivor(s) are on.
  - Slight buff taking inspiration from Kindred to mildly increase the strength of the perk without changing it's effects drastically.
- In addition to the Survivior(s)'s aura, the aura of their generator is also revealed for the duration.
  - Makes it easier to determine which generators are being worked on at a glance, including if the survivor is repairing the generator from the opposing side from you.


## [Better than New](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Better_than_New>) 📉 🗑️

- Additionally increase the action speeds of Gate-Opening, Unhooking, Rummaging, Sabotaging, Inovcating
  - Mild buff to the usage of the perk, most of these will likely see little use in actual games but don't have much risk of causing problems on an already relatively weak and particularly low-usage perk.


## [Bite the Bullet](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Bite_the_Bullet>) 📉 🗑️

- Additionally Suppress Pools of Blood
  - Thematic added effects to slightly increase the strength level of a weak perk.
- Only suppresses the above and existing effects from the Killer
  - Ensures that the benefits of the perk don't incidentally make it more difficult to be healed by a teammate.
- Increased penalty reduction to **2/1/0%** *(was 3/2/1%)*
  - Slight number buff on an already very weak perk.
- Failing skill checks no longer pauses healing progress
  - Another slight buff, introducing a new function on an already very weak perk.


## [Blast Mine](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Blast_Mine>) 🗑️

- No longer blinds Survivor(s) within range of the generator
  - Removes the potential penalty to the user of the perk in addition to their teammates on a medicore perk.
- Blast mines deactivates once a trap has been installed instead of becoming a timer
  - Unlocks the potential to use the perk as an info perk, and removes the awkward decision of whether or not to use a blast mine on an already well-repaired generator and discouraging sitting on a Blast Mine for the majority of the game instead of retrieving new ones. Turns Blast Mine into a partial alternative to Repressed Alliance for anti-gen-kick, without stepping on it's toes too much.


## [Blood Pact](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Pact>) 📉

- Remove injured condition, allowing aura read to/from obsession while healthy
  - Slight buff to info making it easier to buddy up with the obsession prior to their injury, making it easier to coordinate activating the haste portion of the perk.
- Add the "linger" effect from Teamwork: Power of Two
  - Quality of life change to make it a bit more forgiving when looping with friends.
- If you are the obsession, only deactivate aura unless the haste effect is active.
  - Minor buff that simply makes it so being turned into the obsession by another perk doesn't have the potential to complete nullify your already mid-tier perk.


## [Blood Rush](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Rush>) 📉 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 🔬

- No longer deactivates on Conspicuous Action
  - Allows you to heal yourself and work on objectives shortly after being unhooked while still maintaining your suboptimal anti-tunnel.
- Activating blood rush maintains your current Exhausted percentage while allowing you to activate an exhaustion perk
  - Enables tactical 99ing of exhaustion perks alongside Blood Rush, rather tha discouraging it.

and either:

- Removed cooldown
  - Seemed like something else needed to improve the reliability of getting perk value, this seemed like the better option rather than allowing this to be used too aggressively in end-game. This also separates it from the similar 60 and 80 seconds of Decisive Strike/Clean Break and Off The Record. Could potentially move to a 120 second cooldown or similar in lieu of removing it.

or

- No longer disables once the Exit Gates are powered
  - Simply removing a deactivation condition to increase the perks viability. Less preferable than removing the 60 second timer because having everything but the kitchen sink thrown at the killer in end-game isn't really fun gameplay.


## [Boil Over](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boil_Over>) 😷 *🗑️ (on most maps)*

- Grants the ability for all Survivors to read the Auras of all Hooks within **16 meters** of the carried Survivor
  - Adds an info effect to the perk.
- Now increases the Sabotage speed of Survivor(s) within **16 meters** by **15%**
  - Plays further into the idea of it being a "come and help me perk", making it viable to encourage sabo-teamplay without overshadowing Saboteur.
- Allows the Survivor to control the direction of the killer's wiggle strafes
  - Adds a unique wiggle effect that plays into the theme of the perk, while accomodating for the nerf below in a way that hopefully makes the perk more consistent across maps without feeling too cheesy or weak.
- Removed **33%** wiggle progression penalty when falling from a height
  - This was an unhealthy portion of the perk that fundamentally relied on sort of cheesy map abuse to see proper value, in general only receiving value when there's little to no counterplay from the Killer side.


## [Bond](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Bond>)

- Additionally shows your teammates within range your Aura.
  - Quality of life change improving it further where it already performs best, in smaller party sizes.


## [Boon: Circle of Healing](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boon:_Circle_of_Healing>) 🗑️ 🔬

- Apply the healing bonus to self-heal (does not directly allow self heal, requires a med-kit or Self Care)
  - Substantially increases the viability of the perk by adding a strong secondary use-case without trumping other healing perks and still encouraging multi-heal-perk synergies.

or

- Remove Med-Kit exception to altruistic healing speed bonus
  - Generally increasing viability of the perk by removing a situation where it previously made no difference.
- Remove injured predicate on aura reveal
  - Provides the opportunitiy for an injured survivor to navigate directly to a healthy player with a healing build within a boon for an extremely fast multi-person reset.
- Increased altruistic healing speed bonus to **150%** *(from 100%)*
  - Numbers buff to increase the general viability of the perk, offsetting the time loss of traversing into the Boon's range.


## [Boon: Dark Theory](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boon:_Dark_Theory>) 📉 🗑️

- Increased duration to **2/4/6 seconds** *(from 2/3/4)*

## [Boon: Exponential](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boon:_Exponential>) 📉 🗑️

  - Thematic buff to the otherwise okay perk on it's own without causing too much trouble with perk synergy (Conviction).


## [Boon: Illumination](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boon:_Illumination>) 📉 🗑️

- Additionally highlight the Auras of Totems, Exit Gate Switches, and other Survivors
  - Slight increase to the number of tracked auras for a slight info improvement.
- Increased bonus Totem cleansing speed to **25%** *(was 10%)*
  - Increases the ability to use Illumination as an anti-Hex boon.
- Increased bonus Totem blessing speed to **100%** *(was 10%)*
  - Makes moving your Boon around to a more fitting environment significantly less punishing and much more viable to do on repeat
- Effect lingers for **2/4/6 seconds** after leaving the Boon Totem's range
  - Makes it slightly easier to navigate to objectives outside of the Boon's range, more quality of life but technically a slight buff.


## [Boon: Shadow Step](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boon:_Shadow_Step>) 📉 🗑️

- Suppresses the sound of footsteps and prevents loud noise notifications from triggering
  - Plays further into the stealth concept of the perk while allowing quiet resets even if someone misses a skill check.

  - Slight numbers buff to a low playrate perk without much risk for abuse.


## [Borrowed Time](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Borrowed_Time>) 📉 🗑️

- Grants the unhooker **10 seconds** of Endurance (only before exit gates have been powered)
  - Converts BT into an altruistic Anti-Camp perk pre-endgame denying a free 1 for 1 by proxy camping killers. Disproportionately affects killers who wouldn't have triggered AFC (Anti-Facecamp) which are primarily high tiers.

or

- Increased Haste & Endurance effect to **11/13/15 seconds** *(was 6/8/10)*
  - Sizable numbers buff to increase the viability of the perk in a post-basekit-BT world.
- Use the Activate ability button to grant the unhooker 15 seconds of Endurance once per match (incompatible with Shoulder the Burden)
  - Enables the same ability from our preferred buff but in a much more limited capacity, with the benefit of it being usable in endgame. This also disallows use with shoulder in this case, meaning you can't get free endurance AND take the survivors health state at the very end of the game.


## [Botany Knowledge](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Botany_Knowledge>) 🔬 💡

- Increased altruistic Healing speed to **35/65/75%** *(was 30/40/50%)*, Self-Healing speed remains the same.
  - Buff to the altruistic aspect of the perk without risking self-healing becoming too oppressive.


## [Breakdown](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Breakdown>) 📉 😷 🗑️ 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 🔬

- If the killer is within **16 meters** when you're unhooked, they're given **10% Hinder** for **15 Seconds**
  - This effectively mimicks Forced Hesitation and moves a fringe relatively unhealthy perk in the direction of being Anti-Camp based.
- Reduce hook respawn time to **60 seconds** *(was 180)*
  - Compensatory reduction in duration as a result of the change above, additionally 3 minutes of not being able to simply hook someone under that hook is very likely to cause extreme slugging scenarios, two minutes probably isn't too far off of 3, but could be adjusted in accordance with the numbers of the above change.


## [Breakout](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Breakout>) 📉

- Increased range to **6 meters** *(was 5)*
  - Mild buff to make the perk slightly safer, particularly in scenarios where the players invovled have a poor connection or Agitation is in play. This change partially reverts the one in 7.1.0.


## [Buckle Up](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Buckle_Up>) 📉

No change


## [Built to Last](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Built_to_Last>)

- No longer require the item to be out of charges
  - Simple quality of life change with a trade-off where you can sacrifice a portion of your charges to ensure it's more full for your following usage.


## [Calm Spirit](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Calm_Spirit>) 📉 😷 🗑️

- No longer reduces Interaction speeds
  - Penalizing the user for using the perks own effects is really counterintuitive, this solves that.
- Whenever the Killer scares a Crow while you are inside their Terror Radius and you are not in chase, their Aura is revealed to you for **1/2/3 seconds**
  - Effect taken from Treacherous crows but converted into a solo perk without in-chase benefits, turning calm spirit into a sort of passive info perk that can benefit it's stealth aspects with more proactive stealth.


## [Camaraderie](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Camaraderie>) 📉

- Increased range to **24 meters** *(was 16)*
  - Makes it possible for survivors to activate it from safely outside of AFC range where a proxy-camping killer is likely to reside on the border of.
- Decreased pause time to **22/26/30 seconds** *(was 26/30/34)*
  - Slight duration nerf with cleaner numbers to accomodate for the following larger buff.
- Now applies during summoning phase in addition to struggle phase
  - This does substantially benefit the perk but also takes it more in line with Reassurance, effectively making the trade-off that it's only usable on you but can be used on both stages over being able to be used altruistically.


## [Champion of Light](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Champion_of_Light>) 📉

- Decreased cooldown to **40/30/20 seconds** *(was 60/50/40)*
  - Slight number buff to enable more active use in chase without changing the power level of the perk too much.
- Change Hinder effect to **40% Hinder** for **5 seconds** *(was 50% for 4 seconds)*
  - Increasing effectiveness against high-mobility killers, effecitvely preventing them from using dash type abilites for an additional second, while still giving the survivor the same amount of distance versus low-mobility killers.


## [Chemical Trap](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Chemical_Trap>) 🗑️

- Chemical trap stays inactive indefinitely, allowing multiple to be active at the same time.
  - Stops you from repairing limbo waiting for your existing chem trap to expire, ensuring you're always working towards placing one down. Shouldn't be too spammy since it requires a dropped pallet, and using Any Means Necessary with it would both cause loud noise notifications and require an additional perk slot for very hit-or-miss value.


## [Clairvoyance](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Clairvoyance>) 📉 🗑️

- Uses an Activate Ability button instead of requiring you to be empty handed.
  - Makes the perk significantly less restrictive, no longer discouraging the use of items (that often interact with the objects shown by Clairvoyance)
- Remove range limitation *(was 64m)*
  - Somewhat sizable buff that most brings the power level of the perk to a similar level across all maps.


## [Clean Break](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Clean_Break>) 📉 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

- Disconnect Broken from the perk timer to allow Vigil usage with it, meaning if you decide you want to get healed and preserve Clean Break for your next injure, you can.
  - Minor buff to an already strong perk creating the potential for creative uses of it via perk synergy to encourage higher usage.


## [Come and Get Me!](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Come_and_Get_Me!>) 📉 🗑️

- In addition to revealing your Aura to the killer, reveal the Killer's aura to you for **5 seconds**
  - Helps with the goal of the perk which is to get the killer to chase you instead of the other survivors, allowing you to throw yourself in the killers face even if they tried to initially ignore you to tunnel.
- Remove injured/dying requirement for stealth aspects
  - Allows you to assist healthy survivors that are death hook but were nearby as you saved (for instance due to a lack of communication as a result of low-party size), somewhat avoiding soft-tunnelling.


## [Conviction](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Conviction>) 😷 💪

- Tie the dying state re-entry timer to the perk, meaning it cannot be reactivate during the duration of the timer.
  - Prevents "Conviction loops" where two players with conviction alternate picking each other up and going down infinitely on rotation.
- Only activate on altruistic healing actions
  - Prevents misuse of self-recovery perks like Unbreakable, Exponential, and Soul Guard in addition to encouraging altruistic behavior on an otherwise more-selfish strong perk.


## [Corrective Action](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Corrective_Action>) 📉 🗑️

- Reveal the aura of the Survivor(s) who consumed a token until they finish their interaction.
  - Increases the strength of the Aura reveal providing more info on who is doing what passively.
- Remove token limit
  - Allows the user to store a large buffer of skill check improvement tokens that can be used even in a situation where they're left on hook.
- Turns Failed Skill Checks into Good Skill Checks and grants non-Med-Kit Good Skill Checks an additional **1%** bonus progression
  - Greatly increases the viability of the perk and moves it from being primarily a new-player aid to an assistant across all skill levels, similar to Stake out but altruistic. Med-kit skill checks are specifically exempt to prevent balancing issues around Self-Healing and Suture type addons.


## [Counterforce](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Counterforce>) 📉 🗑️

- Change Totem Aura reveal from farthest to nearest
  - Significantly lessens travel time.
- Increased Totem Aura reveal to **20 seconds** *(was 14)*
  - Minor number bump to make it easier to navigate to a totem, particularly on in-door maps.
- Increased default Cleansing speed to **150%** *(was 125%)*
  - Minor number bump to increase the perk's overall strength slightly.


## [Cut Loose](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Cut_Loose>) 📉 🗑️

- Remove cooldown
  - Cooldown isn't particularly necessary because the chaining of the effect is lost after it's pre-existing timer expires and the effect isn't particulrarly strong.
- Increased timer to **6/7/8** seconds *(was 4/5/6)*
  - Makes the timer a bit more forgiving, enabling chaining to be slightly more viable as the cost of unnecessarily incrementing window-entity-blocks is cost enough on it's own.


## [Dance With Me](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dance_With_Me>) 📉 🗑️

- Activates upon Rushed Vaulting a pallet
  - Simply adds an additional method of activation to a relatively weak perk.


## [Dark Sense](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dark_Sense>) 📉 🗑️

- Decreased range to **16 meters** *(was 24)*
  - Increases the skill range where this perk is still reasonably useful.
- Increased Aura Reveal to **8/10/12 seconds** *(was 5/7/10)*
  - Mild numbers increase to increase the strength of a low strength perk.


## [Dead Hard](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dead_Hard>)

- Can now be used twice per trial, rather than after being unhooked
  - Allows the perk to still have use if the user isn't chased/hooked very much and adds a layer of strategy having the option to use endurance early on to delay a first down or extend a more-vital chase when you otherwise wouldn't have had the perk active. Also punishes killers for dropping chase after deep wounding, as the Exhaustion will likely be gone by the time they're chased again.


## [Deadline](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Deadline>) 📉 🗑️

- Removed injured requirement
  - Makes the perks more reasonably useful for the majority of the match.
- Increased skill check trigger chance to **8/10/12%** *(was 6/8/10%)*
  - Noticeable strength increase to increase playrate of a low-tier perk.
- Decreased penalty for missed skilled skill checks to **75%** *(was 50%)*
  - Minor number change to incentivize using the perk by making the added skill check difficulty less penalizing.


## [Deception](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Deception>) 📉 🗑️

- Suppress Grunts of Pain as well
- Instead of attempting to rush-enter the locker to activate, instead use an Activate Ability button.


## [Decisive Strike](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Decisive_Strike>) 😷 💪

- Timer no longer decreases in chase
  - Prevents the survivor from being punished for peforming well in chase
- Decreased timer to **30 seconds** *(was 60)*
  - This prevents the killer from being punished for chasing and downing another survivor, and then stumbling back upon you 30-60 second later and being punished for it


## [Déjà Vu](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Déjà_Vu>) 💪

- Make Repair speed bonus is predicative upon Generator Aura.
  - This allows for counterplay via Blindness-inflicting perks, e.g. Mindbreaker.


## [Deliverance](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Deliverance>) 😷 💪 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

- Deactivates once the end game collapse begins
  - Prevents loss conditions outside of the killer's control.
- Disabled for the remainder of the trial after being unhooked
  - Simply a visual improvement because as of right now it displays active even when the perk is unusable.
- Increased broken status effect to **140/130/120 seconds** *(was 100/80/60)*
  - Number change to offset the strength of the perk.
- Receive **10% Hinder** for **10 seconds** on Self-Unhook
  - Effectively removes basekit BT's 10% Haste effect
- While unhooking another Survivor without any hook states, scream after completing the unhook action
  - Allows other players to identify the perk has been activated, similar to Shoulder the Burden.
- Unique animation or visual effect for the Survivor on Hook if the perk is active and they are in the Summoning Phase.
  - Allows other players to know that the perk is in play.


## [Desperate Measures](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Desperate_Measures>)

No change


## [Detective's Hunch](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Detective%27s_Hunch>) 📉 🗑️

- Additionally reveals the auras of the Hatch and Exit Gate Switches
  - Brings it closer in strength to Clairvoyance
- Remove range limitation *(was 32/48/64m)*
  - Provides a minor strength increase to a very weak and heavily outclassed perk.
- Increased duration to **30 seconds** *(was 20)*
  - Minor strength increase without stepping on the toes of Visionary


## [Distortion](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Distortion>) 😷

- Start the trial with **0 Tokens** *(was 1)*
  - Makes early game stealth less viable, requiring you to engage with the killer first to receive the stealth benefits when you need them more later (e.g. after a likely Health state loss or Hook stage)
- Every time your Aura is read by the killer, consume **-1 Token**, preventing your Aura from being read for **2 seconds** *(was 8/10/12)*
  - This change makes token consumption relative to the duration of the Aura read, meaning you will use less tokens from lower-duration Aura reveals, and no longer nullify Lethal Pursuer's secondary effect. Additionally, this makes it easier to identify the exact duration of an Aura read, letting you more accurately determine what caused your Aura to be revealed.
- For every **7/6/5 seconds** *(was 15)* spent in a Chase, recharge **+2 Tokens** *(was 1)*, up to a maximum of **10 Tokens** *(was 2)*
  - Increasing the rate at which tokens are gained but with compensatory lower-length effects per token makes the amount of Aura-shielding more directly correlated to actual chase time, rather than how often you hit the nearest increment of 15 seconds.
- Deactivates while you are the **Last Survivor Standing**
  - Decreases the likelihood of a teammate being slugged for an extended period of time, making it more difficult for the Distortion user to stealth the duration of their bleed-out timer, encouraging them to go for the pick-up once there's an opportunity to do so.


## [Diversion](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Diversion>) 📉 🗑️

- Add **0.6 second** stun on direct impact
  - Base stun length is identical to an enduring stun, allows for precision skill expression on an otherwise mostly playful silly perk.


## [Do No Harm](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Do_No_Harm>) 📉 💡

- Increased altruistic healing speed by **40/50/60%** *(was 30/40/50%)*, up to a maximum of **60/80/100%**.
  - Increases low-stage healing progression while maintaining the same strength late game to prevent it from overshadowing other perks or becoming too oppressive.


## [Dramaturgy](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dramaturgy>)

- No longer randomly selects effects, instead loops through them in order.
  - Less feast or famine, more reliability provides the user an opportunity to decide whether or not to use the perk based on which secondary effect is next up.
- Changed effect order to; Scream, Exposed, Haste, Item
  - Prevents the secondary effect from being particularly impactful in first chase (Exposed/Haste) as well as for early game pressure via a lucky toolbox roll.


## [Duty of Care](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Duty_of_Care>) 📉 💪 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

- No longer provides Haste to all survivors within a set range, instead providing Haste to the Survivor(s) that were protected by the Protection Hit.
  - Prevents the Haste from being given to Survivor(s) other than those getting hit tanked for.
- Reduced duration to **1/2/3 seconds** *(was 4/5/6)*
  - Reduces the strength of the perk, combined with the below change this is intended to make the perk a lot more healthy and less unfun to go against.
- Now provides the Survivor who takes the Protection Hit with Duty of Care **25% Haste** for **1/2/3 seconds** as well.
  - Allows for hit-tanking survivor to take the hit and then safely escape after doing so.


## [Empathic Connection](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Empathic_Connection>) 📉

No changes


## [Empathy](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Empathy>)

- Remove injured/dying survivor range limitation

## [Exultation](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Exultation>) 📉 🗑️

- No longer only applies on Pallet stun, instead applying on all stuns.
  - Allows for more perk synergy
- Recharges the Item by **+80/90/100%** *(was 75%)*
  - Slight numbers buff to increase strength level
