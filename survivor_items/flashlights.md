### [Odd Bulb](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Odd_Bulb>) (Red)

- Now causes the flashlight beam to have a wavey heat mirage
  - Makes it possible to quickly identify that the add-on is in play mid-match

and

- No longer affects the brightness, duration, or battery depletion rate
- Initially blinding the killer now stuns them for the duration of the initial blind
  - This specifically does not allow stuns on chain-blind. Notably, killers are immune to stuns during fixed animations such as break actions, vaulting, beginning a survivor pick-up, while, hooking, and so on, meaning that the blind needs to be timed to complete once the action has completed but not too long after otherwise the killer can look away subverting the blind and it's associated Odd Bulb stun.
