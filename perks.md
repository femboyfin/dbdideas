# DBD Perk changes

These changes are made with the following goals in mind (roughly in order of highest-lowest):

1. **Increase viability of lower pick rate perks.** This is in line with the recent [direction BHVR has been moving in](https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/513#:~:text=buffed%20some%20perks%20which%20boasted%20lower%20pick%20rates) with these types of perks.

2. **Lessen unhealthiness of unhealthy perks**, unhealthy perks being those with a steep "fun gradient", where a perk increases one sides fun significantly less than it decreases the opposing side's.

3. **Normalize perk strength.** This means overall increasing the strength of lower-tier perks and decreasing the strength of higher tier ones, which encourages a larger perk variety during serious play.

⭐ Indicates our preferred change out of a series of "this or this" changes.


## Survivor Perks

### [Adrenaline](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Adrenaline)

- Remove 3-second 50% Haste bonus and Exhausted status effect
  - Lowers the strength level by normalizing the value of the perk, removing it's secondary effect.


### [Aftercare](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Aftercare)

- Once you're hooked, no longer track the auras of the 2 longest tracked survivors, instead of resetting all auras
  - Makes an already weak perk that's primarily useful in low-party-size situations more consistent and therefore viable.


### [Alert](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Alert)

- Trigger aura reveal on vault in addition to break and damage actions ⭐
  - Adds an additional use case of a low tier perk, making it more well-rounded.

or

- Increase aura reveal duration to 10 seconds (from 5 seconds)
  - Numbers buff that extends the practical benefit of the perk, as previously nearly half the duration is simply showing the Survivor the killer's kick animation.


### [Any Means Necessary](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Any_Means_Necessary)

- Permanently reveal the aura of dropped pallets, even once picked up
  - Slight side benefit that lessens the mental workload of cataloging pallets over time as a reward for using the perk's primary purpose.


### [Apocalyptic Ingenuity](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Apocalyptic_Ingenuity)

- Change activation condition to repairing 40% of a generator (was unlock/rummage two chests)
  - Greatly increases it's viability for use throughout the match by removing the need to accomplish a side objective to activate your perk which in and of itself is effectively a side objective.
- Reduce rebuild time to 3 seconds from 4 seconds
  - Slight numbers buff to an already relatively weak perk, without causing problems with unavoidable stuns.


### [Appraisal](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Appraisal)

- Increase action speed of unlocking in addition to rummaging
  - Makes the perk more universally useful when interacting with chests, lessening the imapct of completing a side-objective as required for the rest of the perk's functions.
- Increase action speed bonus from 40/60/80% to 60/80/100%
  - Slight numbers buff increasing the speed benefit again to lessen the impact of going out of your way to complete a side objective.

and either:

- Remove limitation of two rummages per chest ⭐
  - Removes the need to scour the map for multiple chests to get full value from your perk, again reducing the time spent on side-objectives.

or

- Gain a token every time you deplete an item
  - Makes the perk effectively renewable, allowing it to ensure you always (at least can) have an item throughout the trial.


### [Autodidact](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Autodidact)

- Allow gaining tokens from Self-Heal, only restricting the progression modifier to altruistic healing
  - Allows gaining altruistic benefits from Self-Healing, without being fundamentally broken with uber-fast Self-Healing, removing the bar of only gaining tokens via Altruistic healing for another niche improvement.
- Allow usage with Med-Kits
  - Straightforward removal of one of the perk downsides to increase it's overall viability and opportunities for synergy.
- Adjust skillcheck healing progress by token to: 0/10/20/30/40/60
  - Slight numbers buff avoiding the awkward situation where the first Autodidact skill check could potentially cause a teammate's heal to be incomplete because of the -15% progress, removing an artifical downside aside from the inability to hit great skill checks.


### [Babysitter](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Babysitter)

- Suppress Grunts of Pain in addition to Scratch Marks and Pools of Blood
  - Secondary still-thematic effects that synergize well with the perks perfect while not making it [too powerful](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Babysitter#Patch_9.0.0).


### [Background Player](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Background_Player)

- Change activation condition to pressing an Active Ability button while a survivor is being carried. ⭐
  - Prevents accidental activations and allows more thoughtful gameplay for one of the less-used Exhaustion perks.

or

- Reduce Exhaustion duration to 5 seconds.
  - Accidental activations are less punishing and allows easier synergy with other Exhaustion perks to be more viable.


### [Balanced Landing](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Balanced_Landing)

- Separate stagger reduction from Exhaustion (partially reverting 3.4.0)
  - Increases the consistency of map-specific, low-use exhaustion perk across a variety maps, potentially opening up the doors to unqiue plays in and out of chase that are otherwise unachievable


### [Bardic Inspiration](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Bardic_Inspiration)

- Remove range limitation (was 16m)
  - Allows the perk to have a global rather than localized effect, making it somewhat an opposing counterpart to Prove Thyself
- Reduce cooldown to 52/44/36 seconds
  - Allows for the strategic gambling of getting a higher roll, without making getting a low roll instantly cause you to re-roll on repeat.
- Increase skillcheck trigger chance by 0/1/2/3% based on roll
  - Increases the overall strength of the perk, hopefully not too much.


### [Better Together](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Better_Together)

- In addition to other survivors seeing the generator you are on, you also see the generator other survivors are on.
  - Slight buff taking inspiration from Kindred to mildly increase the strength of the perk without changing it's effects drastically.
- In addition to the survivor's aura, the aura of their generator is also revealed for 30 seconds.
  - Makes it easier to determine which generators are being worked on at a glance, including if the survivor is repairing the generator from the opposing side from you.


### [Better than New](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Better_than_New)

- Additionally increase the action speeds of Gate-Opening, Unhooking, Rummaging, Sabotaging, Inovcating
  - Mild buff to the usage of the perk, most of these will likely see little use in actual games but don't have much risk of causing problems on an already relatively weak and particularly low-usage perk.


### [Bite the Bullet](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Bite_the_Bullet)

- Additionally Suppress Sounds of Breathing and Pools of Blood
  - Thematic added effects to slightly increase the strength level of a weak perk.
- Only suppresses the above and existing effects from the Killer
  - Ensures that the benefits of the perk don't incidentally make it more difficult to be healed by a teammate.
- Increase penalty reduction to 2/1/0% (from 3/2/1%)
  - Slight number buff on an already very weak perk.
- Failing skill checks no longer pauses healing progress
  - Another slight buff, introducing a new function on an already very weak perk.


### [Blast Mine](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Blast_Mine)

- No longer blinds survivors within 12.5m of the generator
  - Removes the potential penalty to the user of the perk in addition to their teammates on a medicore perk.
- Blast mine stays inactive indefinitely, allowing multiple to be active at the same time.
  - Unlocks the potential to use the perk as an info perk, and removes the awkward decision of whether or not to use a blast mine on an already well-repaired generator and discouraging sitting on a Blast Mine for the majority of the game instead of retrieving new ones. Turns Blast Mine into a partial alternative to Repressed Alliance for anti-gen-kick, without stepping on it's toes too much.


### [Blood Pact](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Pact)

- Remove injured condition, allowing aura read to/from obsession while healthy
  - Slight buff to info making it easier to buddy up with the obsession prior to their injury, making it easier to coordinate activating the haste portion of the perk.
- Add the buffer "linger" effect from Power of Two
  - Quality of life change to make it a bit more forgiving when looping with friends.
- If you are the obsession, only deactivate aura unless the haste effect is active.
  - Minor buff that simply makes it so being turned into the obsession by another perk doesn't have the potential to complete nullify your already mid-tier perk.


### [Blood Rush](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Rush)

- Activating blood rush maintains your current Exhausted percentage while allowing you to activate an exhaustion perk
  - Enables tactical 99ing of exhaustion perks alongside Blood Rush, rather tha discouraging it.
- No longer deactivates on Conspicuous Action
  - Allows you to heal yourself and work on objectives shortly after being unhooked while still maintaining your suboptimal anti-tunnel.

and either:

- No longer has a 60 second cooldown ⭐
  - Seemed like something else needed to improve the reliability of getting perk value, this seemed like the better option rather than allowing this to be used too aggressively in end-game. This also separates it from the similar 60 and 80 seconds of Decisive Strike/Clean Break and Off The Record. Could potentially move to a 120 second cooldown or similar in lieu of removing it.

or

- No longer disables once the Exit Gates are powered
  - Simply removing a deactivation condition to increase the perks viability. Less preferable than removing the 60 second timer because having everything but the kitchen sink thrown at the killer in end-game isn't really fun gameplay.


### [Boil Over](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boil_Over)

- Grants the ability for all Survivors to read the Auras of all Hooks within 16m of the carried survivor
  - Turns the perk into a Leader-esque "come and help me" perk as well as an info perk.
- Increases the Sabotage speed of Survivors within 16m of the carried survivor by 15%
  - Plays further into the idea of it being a "come and help me perk", making it viable to encourage sabo-teamplay without overshadowing Saboteur.
- Allows the survivor to control the direction of the killer's wiggle strafes
  - Adds a unique wiggle effect that plays into the theme of the perk, while accomodating for the nerf below in a way that hopefully makes the perk more consistent across maps without feeling too cheesy or weak.
- Remove 33% wiggle progression penalty when falling from a height
  - This was an unhealthy portion of the perk that fundamentally relied on sort of cheesy map abuse to see proper value, in general only receiving value when there's little to no counterplay from the Killer side.


### [Bond](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Bond)

- Additionally shows your teammates where you are within the level-dependent range.
  - Quality of life change improving it further where it already performs best, in smaller party sizes.


### [Boon: Circle of Healing](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boon:_Circle_of_Healing)

- Apply the healing bonus to self-heal (does not directly allow self heal, requires a med-kit or Self Care) ⭐
  - Substantially increases the viability of the perk by adding a strong secondary use-case without trumping other healing perks and still encouraging multi-heal-perk synergies.

or

- Remove Med-Kit exception to altruistic healing speed bonus
  - Generally increasing viability of the perk by removing a situation where it previously made no difference.
- Remove injured predicate on aura reveal
  - Provides the opportunitiy for an injured survivor to navigate directly to a healthy player with a healing build within a boon for an extremely fast multi-person reset.
- Increase altruistic healing speed bonus to 150% (from 100%)
  - Numbers buff to increase the general viability of the perk, offsetting the time loss of traversing into the Boon's range.

- Increase effect linger duration to 2/4/6 seconds (from 2/3/4)

### [Boon: Illumination](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boon:_Illumination)

- Additionally highlight the Auras of Totems, Exit Gate Switches, and other Survivors
  - Slight increase to the number of tracked auras for a slight info improvement.
- Increase Action speed bonus for cleansing to 25%
  - Increases the ability to use Illumination as an anti-Hex boon.
- Separate and increase Action speed bonus for blessing to 100%
  - Makes moving your Boon around to a more fitting environment significantly less punishing and much more viable to do on repeat
- Effect lingers for 2/4/6 after leaving the Boon Totem's range
  - Makes it slightly easier to navigate to objectives outside of the Boon's range, more quality of life but technically a slight buff.


### [Boon: Shadow Step](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Boon:_Shadow_Step)

- Suppresses the sound of footsteps and prevents loud noise notifications from triggering
  - Plays further into the stealth concept of the perk while allowing quiet resets even if someone misses a skill check.
- Increase effect linger duration to 2/4/6 seconds (from 2/3/4)
  - Slight numbers buff to a low playrate perk without much risk for abuse.


### [Borrowed Time](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Borrowed_Time)

- Grants the unhooker 10 seconds of Endurance (only before exit gates have been powered) ⭐
  - Converts BT into an altruistic Anti-Camp perk pre-endgame denying a free 1 for 1 by proxy camping killers. Disproportionately affects killers who wouldn't have triggered AFC (Anti-Facecamp) which are primarily high tiers.

or

- Increase Haste & Endurance effect to 11/13/15 seconds
  - Sizable numbers buff to increase the viability of the perk in a post-basekit-BT world.
- Use the Activate ability button to grant the unhooker 15 seconds of Endurance once per match (incompatible with Shoulder the Burden)
  - Enables the same ability from our preferred buff but in a much more limited capacity, with the benefit of it being usable in endgame. This also disallows use with shoulder in this case, meaning you can't get free endurance AND take the survivors health state at the very end of the game.


### [Botany Knowledge](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Botany_Knowledge)

- Increase altruistic healing speed by an additional 25% (to 35/65/75%)
  - Buff to the altruistic aspect of the perk without risking self-healing becoming too oppressive.


### [Breakdown](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Breakdown)

- If the killer is within 16m when you're unhooked, they're given 15% Hinder for 10 Seconds
  - This effectively mimicks Forced Hesitation and moves a fringe relatively unhealthy perk in the direction of being Anti-Camp based.
- Reduce hook respawn time to 120 seconds (from 180)
  - Compensatory reduction in duration as a result of the change above, additionally 3 minutes of not being able to simply hook someone under that hook is very likely to cause extreme slugging scenarios, two minutes probably isn't too far off of 3, but could be adjusted in accordance with the numbers of the above change.


### [Breakout](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Breakout)

- Increase range from 5 meters to 6 meters (partially reverts 7.1.0)
  - Slight buff to make the perk slightly safer, particularly in scenarios where the killer or survivor using it have a poor connection or the Killer is using Agitation.


### [Buckle Up](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Buckle_Up)

No change


### [Built to Last](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Built_to_Last)

- No longer require the item to be completely empty
  - Simple quality of life change with a trade-off where you can sacrifice a portion of your charges to ensure it's more full for your following usage.


### [Calm Spirit](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Calm_Spirit)

- Remove interaction speed penalties
  - The perk penalizing for using the perks own effects is really counterintuitive, this solves that.
- Whenever the Killer scares a Crow while you are inside their Terror Radius and you are not in chase, their Aura is revealed to you for 1/2/3 seconds
  - Effect taken from Treacherous crows but converted into a solo perk without in-chase benefits, turning calm spirit into a sort of passive info perk that can benefit it's stealth aspects with more proactive stealth.


### [Camaraderie](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Camaraderie)

- Increase range to 24m (was 16m)
  - Makes it possible for survivors to activate it from safely outside of AFC range where a proxy-camping killer is likely to reside on the border of.
- Reduce pause time to 22/26/30 seconds
  - Slight duration nerf with cleaner numbers to accomodate for the following larger buff.
- Now applies during summoning phase in addition to struggle phase
  - This does substantially benefit the perk but also takes it more in line with Reassurance, effectively making the trade-off that it's only usable on you but can be used on both stages over being able to be used altruistically.


### [Champion of Light](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Champion_of_Light)

- Reduce cooldown to 40/30/20 seconds (was 60/50/40)
  - Slight number buff to enable more active use in chase without changing the power level of the perk too much.
- Change Hinder effect to 40% Hinder for 5 seconds (was 50% for 4 seconds)
  - Increasing effectiveness against high-mobility killers, effecitvely preventing them from using dash type abilites for an additional second, while still giving the survivor the same amount of distance versus low-mobility killers.


### [Chemical Trap](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Chemical_Trap)

- Chemical trap stays inactive indefinitely, allowing multiple to be active at the same time.
  - Stops you from repairing limbo waiting for your existing chem trap to expire, ensuring you're always working towards placing one down. Shouldn't be too spammy since it requires a dropped pallet, and using Any Means Necessary with it would both cause loud noise notifications and require an additional perk slot for very hit-or-miss value.


### [Clairvoyance](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Clairvoyance)

- Uses an Activate Ability button instead of requiring you to be empty handed.
  - Makes the perk significantly less restrictive, no longer discouraging the use of items (that often interact with the objects shown by Clairvoyance)
- Remove range limitation (was 64m)
  - Somewhat sizable buff that most brings the power level of the perk to a similar level across all maps.


### [Clean Break](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Clean_Break)

- Disconnect Broken from the perk timer to allow Vigil usage with it, meaning if you decide you want to get healed and preserve Clean Break for your next injure, you can.
  - Minor buff to an already strong perk creating the potential for creative uses of it via perk synergy.


### [Come and Get Me!](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Come_and_Get_Me!)

- In addition to revealing your Aura to the killer, reveal the Killer's aura to you for 5 seconds.
  - Helps with the goal of the perk which is to get the killer to chase you instead of the other survivor(s), allowing you to throw yourself in the killers face even if they tried to initially ignore you to tunnel.
- Remove injured/dying requirement for stealth aspects
  - Allows you to assist healthy survivors that are death hook but were nearby as you saved (for instance due to a lack of communication as a result of low-party size), somewhat avoiding soft-tunnelling.


### [Conviction](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Conviction)

- Tie the dying state re-entry timer to the perk, meaning it cannot be reactivate during the duration of the timer.
  - Prevents "Conviction loops" where two players with conviction alternate picking each other up and going down infinitely on rotation.
- Only activate on altruistic healing actions
  - Prevents misuse of self-recovery perks like Unbreakable, Exponential, and Soul Guard in addition to encouraging altruistic behavior on an otherwise more-selfish strong perk.

- Reveal the aura of the survivor who consumed a token until they finish their interaction.
  - Increases the strength of the Aura reveal providing more info on who is doing what passively.

- Turns Failed Skill Checks into Good Skill Checks and grants non-Med-Kit Good Skill Checks an additional 1%
  - Greatly increases the viability of the perk and moves it from being primarily a new-player aid to an assistant across all skill levels,similar to Stake out but altruistic. Med-kit skill checks are specifically exempt to prevent balancing issues around Self-Healing and Suture type addons.


### [Counterforce](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Counterforce)

- Change Totem Aura reveal from farthest to nearest
  - Significantly lessens travel time.
- Increase Totem Aura reveal to 20 seconds
  - Minor number bump to make it easier to navigate to a totem, particularly on in-door maps.
- Increase default Cleansing speed to 150% (was 125%)
  - Minor number bump to increase the perk's overall strength slightly.


### [Cut Loose](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Cut_Loose)

- Remove cooldown
  - Cooldown isn't particularly necessary because the chaining of the effect is lost after it's pre-existing timer expires and the effect isn't particulrarly strong.
- Increase timer to 6/7/8 (was 4/5/6) seconds
  - Makes the timer a bit more forgiving, enabling chaining to be slightly more viable as the cost of unnecessarily incrementing window-entity-blocks is cost enough on it's own.


### [Dance With Me](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dance_With_Me)

- Activates upon Rushed Vaulting a pallet
  - Simply adds an additional method of activation to a relatively weak perk.


### [Dark Sense](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dark_Sense)

- Decrease range to 16m (was 24m)
  - Increases the skill range where this perk is still reasonably useful.
- Increase Aura Reveal to 8/10/12 (was 5/7/10) seconds
  - Mild numbers increase to increase the strength of a low strength perk.


### [Dead Hard](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dead_Hard)

- Can now be used twice per trial, rather than after being unhooked ⭐
  - Allows the perk to still have use if the user isn't chased/hooked very much and adds a layer of strategy having the option to use endurance early on to delay a first down or extend a more-vital chase when you otherwise wouldn't have had the perk active. Also punishes killers for dropping chase after deep wounding, as the Exhaustion will likely be gone by the time they're chased again.


### [Deadline](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Deadline)

- Removed injured requirement
  - Makes the perks more reasonably useful for the majority of the match.
- Increase skill check trigger chance to 8/10/12% (was 6/8/10%)
  - Noticeable strength increase to increase playrate of a low-tier perk.
- Decrease penalty for missed skilled skill checks to 75% (was 50%)
  - Minor number change to incentivize using the perk by making the added skill check difficulty less penalizing.


### [Deception](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Deception)

- Suppress Grunts of Pain as well
- Instead of attempting to rush-enter the locker to activate, instead use an Activate Ability button.


### [Decisive Strike](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Decisive_Strike)

- Timer no longer decreases in chase
  - Prevents the survivor from being punished for peforming well in chase
- Decrease timer to 30 seconds
  - This prevents the killer from being punished for chasing and downing another survivor, and then stumbling back upon you 30-60 second later and being punished for it


### [Déjà Vu](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Déjà_Vu)

- Make Repair speed bonus is predicative upon Generator Aura.
