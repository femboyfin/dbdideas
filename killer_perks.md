# Killer Perk Changes

Killer perks are a work-in-progress, some changes may not have their reasoning transcribed yet, and many do not have proposed changes.



## [A Nurse's Calling](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/A_Nurse%27s_Calling>)

- Increased range to **24/28/32 meters** *(was 20/24/28 meters)*
  - Slightly increases perk strength, also keeps the numbers more in line with the standard multiples-of-8 numbering scheme which should make the values slightly more memorable.

## [Agitation](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Agitation>)

No changes


## [Alien Instinct](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Alien_Instinct>) 📉 🗑️

- Increased Aura reveal duration to **16 seconds** *(was 8 seconds)*
  - Sizable numbers buff to increase perk strength and therefor playrate.


## [All-Shaking Thunder](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/All-Shaking_Thunder>) 📉

- Now gain **+2 Tokens** up to a maximum of **2 Tokens** after falling from a height
  - Now functions similarly to Coup de Grâce stacks, where you get 2 extended lunges per activation, which should bring it closer in line to it's lunge-extending cousin.
- Now consumes **-1 Token** every time you perform a Lunge Attack
  - Now being token based we simply subtract one Token per lunge.
- Removed deactivation timer *(was 8/12/16)*
  - No longer makes sense as it's now Token based.
- Increased cooldown to **60 seconds** *(was 5 seconds)*
  - Prevents it from being too oppressive in specific scenarios (we don't want this to become Balanced Landing that doesn't trigger Exhausted)


## [Awakened Awareness](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Awakened_Awareness>) 📉 🗑️

- Added a linger effect to the Aura of Survivors within range of a successful Hook, this lingering Aura reveal lasts for **8 seconds**
  - Increases the perk strength quite considerably while buffing specifically the scenarios where you aren't picking someone up purely for backpack build benefits, incentivizing actually getting the hook and not purely trying to snowball with a backpack build.
- Increased range to **24 meters** *(was 20 meters)*
  - Mild numbers buff to increase perk strength, now in line with the size of small killer Terror Radii


## [Bamboozle](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Bamboozle>)

No changes; high risk (buffing has the potential to make it effectively guarantee a hit before the Survivor can reach another resource at a large number of tiles).


## [Barbecue & Chilli](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Barbecue_%26_Chilli>)

No changes; upcoming changes (9.2.0 PTB).


## [Batteries Included](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Batteries_Included>) 🗑️

- Increased linger duration to **4/6/8 seconds** *(was 1/3/5 seconds)*
  - Slight numbers buff to a mediocre situational perk, should increase viability prior to gates being powered without making it that much stronger in end game where it already shines.


## [Beast of Prey](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Beast_of_Prey>) 📉 🗑️

- Now grants Undetectable status effect as long as the Bloodlust status effect is active
  - Partially reverts a change from [8.5.0](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Beast_of_Prey#Patch_8.5.0:~:text=Nerf:%20Undetectable%20now%20lasts%20for%20a%20limited%20time%20after%20gaining%20Bloodlust%2C%20instead%20of%20for%20as%20long%20as%20Bloodlust%20is%20active.>) where it was somewhat reworked at the time it lost it's Bloodpoint bonus, effectively makes it so the 8.5.0 changes plus this change make it a direct buff rather than a sidegrade.
- Now grants **30/35/40 seconds** of Undetectable upon losing the Bloodlust status effect
  - Maintains the 40 second linger effect from the current post-8.5.0 version, maintaining it's niche as a drop-and-surprise on demand jump scare type of stealth perk.


## [Bitter Murmur](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Bitter_Murmur>) 🗑️

- Now applies to all generators, not only the one that was completed
  - Sizable buff turning this into a pretty solid info perk, enabling you to decide between going after the survivors who just completed the generator or interrupt another in progress one.
- Reduced range to **4 meters** *(was 16 meters)*
  - Ensures it only applies to people effectively working on generators without directly tying it to players repairing generators to avoid survivors dodging bitter murmur (either intentionally or unintentionally) in the same way Pain Resonance's explosion is dodged.
- Now lingers for the duration once leaving the radius rather than immediately losing Aura reveal
  - Ensures this remains purely a buff not a sidegrade, guaranteeing your 5 seconds of Aura reveal on all affected survivors.


## [Blood Echo](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Echo>) 📉 🗑️

- Increased duration to **30/35/40 seconds** *(was 20/25/30 seconds)*
  - Mild numbers buff increasing general perk strength
- Now inflicts the Mangled status effect as well
  - Noticeable buff to the anti-heal portion of the perk, currently without supplementary aura reading perks it can be extremely difficult to actually locate someone and interrupt their normal speed heal to get Hemorrhage value, ideally mangled will lessen the frequency of this and make heal interrupts and therefor Hemorrhage value more often.


## [Blood Warden](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Warden>) 🗑️

- No longer blocks Exit Gates
  - This is the most controversial and relatively unhealthy portion of the perk. With no active way to identify it before it's activation, Blood Warden "scares" fundamentally change the survivors have to play end game even when the perk isn't in play. A Blood Warden activation in the last quarter of the end game collapse timer guarantees four kills and effectively holds all players in the trial for an additional minute when the outcome is already predetermined.
- Now reduces the End Game Collapse Timer by **30/40/50%** of it's remaining duration
  - Shifts Blood Warden to greatly increase the otherwise very limited pressure gained from an end game hook, while also encouraging multiple hooks during end game. This should effectively give you you a viable alternative to camping out each hook you get in end game, and make those last minute end game saves higher stakes. This also punishes survivors messing up an end game save rather than allowing 2-4 minutes of repeated save attempts (hook states allowing) to inch the hook location closer and closer to the gate.
- Added a **5 seconds** linger duration to the Exit Gate Aura reveal
  - Mildly increases the strength of the Aura reveal, this should prevent situations where the survivors ran out of the gate just in time before you could turn and look.


## [Bloodhound](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Bloodhound>) 📉 🗑️

- Increased duration to **3/4/5 seconds** *(was 2/3/4 seconds)*
  - Slight numbers buff, increasing this too much has the potential to make tracking *more* confusing as it can become harder to determine direction of travel from blood pools immediately.
- Now extends the Lifetime of Scratch Marks as well
  - Provides effective counterplay to Lightweight and Ghost Notes
- Now displays footstep imprints from walking and running Survivors
  - Leans into the tracking aspect of the perk, allowing you to follow the footsteps of walking survivors if you're close enough to see them, enabling you to find a stealthing survivor assuming you already found their approximate location confidently enough to start inspecting the ground.


## [Brutal Strength](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Brutal_Strength>)

- Now grants **5% Haste** for **5 seconds** after completing a Break or Damage action
  - Slight buff without making the breaks themselves too overbearing, should help make up distance from breaking the pallet, eliminating slightly more room for error in survivor positioning around most pallets, making gen kick perks less time intensive to activate, and "mandatory-break" breakable walls (e.g. upstairs dead dawg saloon) less punishing to break at the start, potentially turning them into a utility of sorts.


## [Call of Brine](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Call_of_Brine>) 📉 🗑️

No changes; too recently changed (9.0.0).


## [Corrupt Intervention](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Corrupt_Intervention>)

- Decreased duration to **70/80/90 seconds**
  - Slight nerf that now effectively guarantees other generators become available once a normal-speed generator is completed.
- Now reduces the duration by **60 seconds** per Health State lost
  - Punishes using a hit-and-run play style to gain more pressure than the existing deactivation condition was intended to prevent. Additionally, this should hit higher strength killers harder than lower strength killers by tying the deactivation to the time it takes you to injure survivors. The numbers on this may be slightly too aggressive, but given this is widely considered one of if not the best Killer perk in the game and the main benefit of Corrupt is forcing survivors to relocate and waste time running into blocked gens during the early game, not keeping them from doing specific gens for a set duration, Corrupt should still remain reasonably strong.


## [Coulrophobia](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Coulrophobia>) 📉 🗑️

- Increased Healing Speed penalty to **25/50/75%**
  - Sizable numbers buff that should push survivors to heal outside of the killer's Terror Radius more often, regardless of experience level and ability to hit the faster skill checks.
- Now affects mend times in addition to healing speed
  - Mild strength increase, should benefit lower strength killers more than higher tier ones on average (affected basekit powers are; Skull Merchant, Legion, Knight, Deathslinger, Houndmaster, Wesker, Kaneki)
- Now increases missed skillcheck penalty by **3%**
  - Further motivates survivors to spend the time traveling outside of Terror Radius to heal.


## [Coup de Grâce](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Coup_de_Gr%C3%A2ce>) 📉

No changes


## [Cruel Limits](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Cruel_Limits>) 📉 🗑️

- Now blocks upright Pallets within **32 meters** of the completed Generator for the duration
  - This should especially punish players for (over-)committing to generators, leaving them effectively resource-less for their first hit with limited options thereafter. Should serve to provide more consistent hits during Cruel Limits effects, rather than forcing pallet drops directly.


## [Dark Arrogance](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dark_Arrogance>) 📉 🗑️

- No longer increases Killer Blind duration
  - Fully removes half of the perk's somewhat unnecessary downsides.
- Reduced Pallet Stun Recovery speed to **10%** *(was 25%)*
  - Further reduces the remaining downside's impact
- Increased Vaulting speed to **20/25/30%** *(was 15/20/25%)*
  - Slight numbers buff to increase perk strength, this combined with the lack of downsides could potentially bump it to a level where it's occasionally used outside of full vault speed loadouts.


## [Dark Devotion](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dark_Devotion>) 📉 🗑️

- Now activates when hitting any survivor with a Basic Attack
  - This is a reversion of the change made in [6.1.0](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_Notes_6.1.X#:~:text=Dark%20Devotion-,Now%20triggers%20when%20a%20Survivor%20loses%20a%20health%20state%20by%20any%20means%20(was%20just%20basic%20attacks>). Increases perk strength by separating it from specifically the Obsession, you should see more consistent activations of the perk throughout the trial. Additionally limiting it to Basic Attacks makes the perk slightly less oppressive on higher strength killers and encourages more deliberate and thoughtful activation them.
- Increased duration to **40/50/60 seconds** *(was 35/40/45 seconds)*
  - Sizable numbers buff, increasing the strength a bit by giving you more opportunities to catch someone off guard while your Terror Radius is elsewhere.
- Now activates only on Basic Attack
  - Prevents it from becoming too oppressive on killers with high strength and mobility chase powers (e.g. Blight who can both get a hit and reposition across the map rather quickly).
- While the perk is active, the last Survivor you injured with a Basic Attack receives your Terror Radius and it is set to **40 meters**, granting you the Undetectable status effect
  - Updated perk description to allow it's effects to be transferred to a different survivor for each subsequent basic attack within the same activation.
- Now has a cooldown of **60 seconds**
  - 1:1 activation to cooldown duration to keep it from becoming too overbearing on survivors.


## [Darkness Revealed](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Darkness_Revealed>) 📉 🗑️

- Now grants **5% Haste** for **10 seconds** upon completing a locker search
  - Offsets the cost of performing a locker search and allows you to better take advantage of the info you gain
- Reduced cool-down to **20 seconds** *(was 30 seconds)*
  - Mild numbers buff, this combined with the above change provides potential to use Darkness Revealed to find a survivor and enter chase, then again mid chase.


## [Dead Man's Switch](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dead_Man%27s_Switch>)

No changes; too recently changed (9.2.0 PTB).


## [Deadlock / No Holds Barred](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/No_Holds_Barred>)

No changes


## [Deathbound](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Deathbound>) 📉 🗑️

- Now applies Oblivious to the Healed Survivor if they're too far from the Healer
  - Forces both survivors to buddy up for the duration, rather than the current one-sided interaction where the Healer has to follow the Healed even if the Healed doesn't understand what Deathbound is.
- Now reveals the Aura of the Healer to to the Healed Survivor
  - Makes it viable for the Healed Survivor to stay in range of one another.
- No longer reveals the Survivors Auras to each other when they're within range
  - Extremely minor buff, eliminates niche scenarios where the aura can slightly benefit survivors (e.g. on indoor maps, when coordinating Head On stuns, and/or coordinating well timed body blocks/hit tanks.
- Now reveals the Aura of the Survivors to the Killer for **5 seconds** if they go out of range
  - Creates a real for partied survivors who are able to communicate the killer's position accurately, limiting the effectiveness of the Oblivious effect.


## [Deerstalker](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Deerstalker>) 📉 🗑️

No changes; upcoming changes (9.2.0 PTB).


## [Discordance](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Discordance>)

- Now reveals the Aura of the Survivors working on the affected Generator, this lingers for **3/4/5 seconds** after they stop repairing
  - Enables the killer to identify who is stacking the same generator, how many survivors are stacking the same generator, exactly when one or more of them stops stacking the generator, and which direction they go when they get off of the generator.
- Now varies the intensity of the affected Generator's Aura based on the number of Survivors repairing it simultaneously
  - Makes it easier to tell at a glance how many people are stacking an affected generator.
- Removed Range limitation
  - Mild buff, effectively only removes edge-cases on very large maps. Made possible because we now have the Survivor Aura reveal as a variable stat.


## [Dissolution](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dissolution>) 📉 🗑️

- Reduced grace period duration to **1 second** *(was 3 seconds)*
  - Mild buff that still allows Survivors to vault a pallet as they get hit, but punishes them for vaulting during their on-hit Haste.
- Increased effect duration to **15/20/25 seconds** *(was 12/16/20 seconds)*
  - Mild buff to generally increase the perk's strength level.


## [Distressing](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Distressing>) 📉 🗑️

- Increased Terror Radius bonus to **40%** *(was 30%)*
  - Sizable numbers buff to increase the perk's impact.


## [Dominance](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dominance>) 📉

- Increased duration to **12/16/20 seconds** *(was 8/12/16 seconds)*
  - Mild numbers buff increasing the impact of the perks current effect and the new effect below.
- Now reveals the aura of the Survivor who interacted with the Chest or Totem for the duration
  - Not only provides location information on where *a* survivor is, but also who that survivor is and where they went, should make it much easier to defend a lit Hex by preventively chasing the survivor who knows it's location.


## [Dragon's Grip](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dragon%27s_Grip>) 📉

No changes; too recently changed (9.1.0).


## [Dying Light](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dying_Light>) 📉 🗑️

- Decreased Obsession Action Speed bonus to **20%** *(was 33%)*
  - Reduces the number of situations where the perk is detrimental to run.
- Increased non-Obsession Action Speed penalty to **3/4/5% per Token** *(was 2/2.5/3 per Token)*
  - Sizeable numbers buff, should ensure the perk has a very noticeable impact each trial.
- Now applies Action Speed penalties to all Action Speeds (except vaulting)
  - Mild buff, mostly effects less-critical and less-common action speeds, but will notably slow down gate-opening.


## [Enduring](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Enduring>)

No changes; High risk (buffing does very little for individual use and can quickly become problematic when comboed with some of the perks it synergizes such as Spirit Fury and Hubris).


## [Eruption](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Eruption>)

No changes; too recently changed (9.2.0 PTB).


## [Fire Up](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Fire_Up>) 🗑️

No changes


## [Forced Hesitation](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Forced_Hesitation>) 📉 🗑️

No changes; upcoming changes (9.2.0 PTB Slugging reduction).


## [Forced Penance](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Forced_Penance>) 📉 🗑️

No changes; upcoming changes (9.2.0 PTB Tunnelling reduction).


## [Forever Entwined](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Forever_Entwined>) 📉

- Increased bonus to **5%** *(was 4%)*
  - Slightly increases perk impact, particularly at lower Token counts.
- Increased maximum tokens to **8/9/10 Tokens** *(was 6/7/8 Tokens)*
  - Mildly increases strength at max Tokens.


## [Franklin's Demise](<https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Franklin%27s_Demise>) 📉

- No longer instantly causes the Survivor to drop their Item on Basic Attack
  - Enables a reasonable amount of active Survivor counterplay compared to it's pre-9.1.0 version.
- Now causes Survivors hit with a Basic Attack to automatically fumble their Item in **30 seconds**, losing all charges and leaving it on the ground
  - Flavorful method of forcing the survivor to drop their item or lose it, guarantees either loss of item charges, or loss of distance mid chase, at the survivors discretion.
- Now decreases Survivor Item dropping and pick up speeds by **50%** within the Killer's Terror Radius
  - Increases the detriment survivors receive when dropping their item mid chase making it noticeably more impactful.


<!-- NOTE: The below "Too weak" indicators have not been discussed. As of right now, I've simply marked all perks that are rated at 1 star or 2 stars by Otzdarva's Killer Perk Tierlist (8.3.0) as Too weak. We DO NOT *fully* agree with Otzdarva's ratings, however more often than not, give or take a tier, we do agree with his ratings, making it a reasonable starting point to have laid out ahead of time. These will all be discussed thoroughly as we go through each perk, do not see this as a shortcut, everything will continue to get the attention it deserves.
