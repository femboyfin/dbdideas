# DBD Ideas

This repository is supposed to be an exhaustive list of theoretical positive changes to any and all aspects of Dead by Daylight. Specific priorities and other information like balance priorities are listed below.


## Who's ideas are these? What makes you qualified to suggest balance changes?

These are primarily ideas myself and my friend Echo have come up with and bounced off each other. I started in August of 2024 and have 2,800 hours to date, with the majority of my time duo queuing in public matches. On the other hand, Echo has been playing since shortly after launch and has comp experience, so we both have a reasonably high level of experience in different segments of Dead by Daylight. Some ideas may be the product of cryptomnesia and there's surely going to be plenty of examples of parallel thinking as well, but overall these ideas are from hours of discussion going through element by element of a current feature's implementation and thinking about what we could change to accomplish our [goals](#Goals).


## Current progress

The intention is to slowly iterate through element by element taking the time to make thoughtful changes and then periodically review them. You can see our methodology in the next section.

- [x] [Survivor perks](survivor_perks.md) *as of 9.1.3*
- [ ] [Killer perks](killer_perks.md) **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] [Basekit/miscellaneous](misc.md) **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] Killer powers & addons <!-- [Killer powers & addons](killer) -->
- [ ] Survivor items & addons <!-- [Survivor items & addons](survivor) -->


## Goals

There are multiple factors to consider with any change, but the core goals we have in mind when suggesting changes are:

1. **Increase the pick rate of low pick rate elements.** This goal is in line with the recent [direction BHVR has been moving in](<https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/513#:~:text=buffed%20some%20perks%20which%20boasted%20lower%20pick%20rates>). Keep in mind that pick rate doesn't necessarily equate to strength. Elements flagged solely as low-pick-rate will largely have changes focused on increasing fun, consistency, and quality of life where possible, rather than simply buffing them into the stratosphere to increase usage.

2. **Compress strength gradients.** Basically a fancy way of saying "buff what's weak, nerf what's strong". Effectively, this means making the strength of all elements of a given category (e.g. perks) more-similar in strength level, which should inherently increase variety. Fun factor aside, there's a large portion of people who get their fun from using strong unlockables, meaning if we lower the strength of the highest tier perks for example, there are more options for them to choose from with more varied effects, that results in more diverse and replayable gameplay.

3. **Lessen unhealthy elements.** We have two ways that something can qualify as unhealthy, 1) if something increases one side's fun significantly less than it decreases the opposing side's, and 2) if it provides little to zero counterplay or in other words, reduces how dynamic an interaction is instead of making it more dynamic.

4. **Bridge balancing gaps.** This can primarily be broken down into 4 categories although the concept is also applicable to other more niche situations. Overall this means decreasing the viability disparity (the difference in how effective/useful something is) between matches by reducing the impact of the following match-to-match differences; 1) party size 2) map size, elevation variability, and floor count 3) anything that's particularly weak or strong with a very small subset of killer powers but is the opposite for the remainder of the roster, 4) anything that depends upon or is "hard countered" by a given thing outside of that player's control.


## Glossary

### Emoji markers

We use the following emojis as shorthands to make it easier to view or opinions on something at a glance.

| Emoji | Name          | Description                                                                            |
|-------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  üìâ   | Low pick rate | In the lower two thirds of pick rate according to [NightLight](https://nightlight.gg/) |
|  üò∑   | Unhealthy     | See definition under the [Methodology](#Methodology)                                   |
|  üí™   | Too strong    | Extremely powerful without a need for comboing                                         |
|  üóëÔ∏è   | Too weak      | Either overall low strength or outclassed by similar stronger elements                 |
|  üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë   | Abusable      | High potential to be abused in coordinated groups, particularly by high level players  |
|  üî¨   | Needs testing | Appreciable potential to be problematic (e.g. when comboed), requires playtesting      |
|  üí°   | Idea          | Just an early idea, not necessarily for implementation, and no balance promises        |
|  ‚è≤Ô∏è   | Incoming!     | A feature that has been officially roadmapped and concretely will be implemented soon  |


### Common "No change" reasons

The vast majority of unchanged elements fall under a small handful of reasons, to keep things clean and less repetitive, we simply refer to these as `No change; reason` in place of recommended changes, keeping the breakdown of the reasons centrally here.

#### Too recently changed

It's difficult to evaluate something that has been very recently changed, even minor number tweaks can reposition something in unpredictable ways both in terms of strength and pick rate. Additionally, there are often surges in players using something after it's been updated, as well as other groups of people who don't realize the perk has changed until long after it has been changed, both of these lead to freshly changed perks picked an abnormal amount in the days and sometimes even months after a change has been pushed to live. This combined with the likelihood for players to substitute a single freshly changed perk in with a build of abnormal synergy/strength level can skew kill rate/escape rates and make it difficult to judge how players are adjusting to the new perk immediately. For these reasons, we often prefer to wait to give our feedback on a freshly changed perk in most scenarios, or if we do, it will likely be marked as an Idea and/or Needs testing.

#### Upcoming changes

It is often announced in advanced what elements of the game are being changed in upcoming releases. This most common examples of this are Developer Updates and PTB content, but there are the occasional examples where these are referenced off hand by Developers on official or unofficial accounts across social media and the DBD forums. In general, it's difficult to suggest changes to something that is imminently going to be changed, and the value from discussing the current version that will likely not continue to be the current version very soon is significantly less compared to designing changes for things that don't already have changes in the pipeline. It can also be very insightful seeing something with different numbers, it provides the opportunity to understand how the power level and synergies scale with numbers in a practical environment and enables us to test potential synergies prior to picking numbers we think are reasonable.

#### High risk

Some designs are intrinsically high risk to tamper with. I'll provide two practical examples in the form of perks here; 1) Power Struggle is by design a feast or famine perk where you either get tremendous value or absolutely none, if you get this value too often, it quickly becomes absurdly strong and oppressive, if you don't get it enough it quickly becomes useless, making the activation condition and numbers on a perk like this extremely delicate to tamper with. 2) Slippery Meat/Up The Ante are two perks that are statistically detrimental without multiple players running them, but with enough players stacking luck percentages it quickly becomes extremely oppressive entire removing the need for teammates to come for unhooks, effectively causing hooks to provide zero pressure to the killer, if these are buffed to the point of viability when used by only one person, they suddenly require substantially less loadout slots to pull off this trick, making them even more oppressive when used with coordination. To avoid situations like this, if we don't confidently have a change we can make to something without a high potential of it becoming greatly problematic, we typically won't suggest a change.


## Styling

In order to keep our changes as natural as possible, we do our best to format them familiarly. When describing an idea, we first try to mimic the official patch notes as much as possible (e.g. bolding numbers and their units and suffixing previous values in italics). Second we prioritize the [Wiki's style guide](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki:Style_guide), which provides explicit rules and guidelines to enhance consistency. Finally, we do our best to keep things consistent outside of the aforementioned wherever applicable.

Let's use an example from a recent patch to demonstrate. If we want to lower the duration of insidious from it's previous 4/3/2 seconds to 3/2/1 seconds, the resulting change would be:
- Decreased the time it takes to activate to **3/2/1 second** *(was 4/3/2)*

Note there are two differences from the official patch notes here which are done for clarity:

1. We don't prefix every change with that element's name (e.g. Insidious: is not on the line above that change), instead we use markdown headings for ease of viewing.

2. We do not suffix changes with punctuation in-line, instead reserving end of line punctuation for sub-bullet notes. This makes it easier to identify that our notes are not the theoretical "patch notes".
