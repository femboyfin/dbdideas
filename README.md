# DBD Ideas

This repository is supposed to be an exhaustive list of theoretical positive changes to any and all aspect of Dead by Daylight. Specific priorities and other information is listed below.


## Who's ideas are these? What makes you qualified to suggest balance changes?

These are primarily ideas myself and my partner Echo have come up with and bounced off each other. I started in August of 2024 and have racked up 2,700 hours in my first year of playing, with the majority of my time duo queuing in public matches. On the other hand, Echo has been playing since shortly after launch and has comp experience, so we both have a reasonably high level of experience in different segments of Dead by Daylight. Some ideas may be the product of cryptomnesia and there's surely going to be plenty of examples of parallel thinking as well, but overall these ideas are from hours of discussion going through element by element of a current feature's implementation and thinking about what we could change to accomplish our [goals](#Goals).


## Current progress

The intention is to slowly iterate through element by element taking the time to make thoughtful changes and then periodically review them. You can see our methodology in the next section.

- [x] [Survivor perks](survivor_perks.md) *as of 9.1.3*
- [ ] [Killer perks](killer_perks.md) **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] [Basekit/miscellaneous](misc.md) **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] Killer powers
- [ ] Killer addons
- [ ] Survivor items & addons


## Goals

There are multiple factors to consider with any change, but the core goals we have in mind when suggesting changes are:

1. **Increase the pick rate of low pick rate elements.** This goal is in line with the recent [direction BHVR has been moving in](<https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/513#:~:text=buffed%20some%20perks%20which%20boasted%20lower%20pick%20rates>). Keep in mind that pick rate doesn't necessarily equate to strength. Elements flagged solely as low-pick-rate will largely have changes focused on increasing fun, consistency, and quality of life where possible, rather than simply buffing them into the stratosphere to increase usage.

2. **Compress strength gradients.** Basically a fancy way of saying "buff what's weak, nerf what's strong". Effectively, this means making the strength of all elements of a given category (e.g. perks) more-similar in strength level, which should inherently increase variety. Fun factor aside, there's a large portion of people who get their fun from using strong unlockables, meaning if we lower the strength of the highest tier perks for example, there are more options for them to choose from with more varied effects, that results in more diverse and replayable gameplay.

3. **Lessen unhealthy elements.** We have two ways that something can qualify as unhealthy, 1) if something increases one side's fun significantly less than it decreases the opposing side's, and 2) if it provides little to zero counterplay or in other words, reduces how dynamic an interaction is instead of making it more dynamic.

4. **Bridge balancing gaps.** This can primarily be broken down into 4 categories although the concept is also applicable to other more niche situations. Overall this means decreasing the viability disparity (the difference in how effective/useful something is) between matches by reducing the impact of the following match-to-match differences; 1) party size 2) map size, elevation variability, and floor count 3) anything that's particularly weak or strong with a very small subset of killer powers but is the opposite for the remainder of the roster, 4) anything that depends upon or is "hard countered" by a given thing outside of that player's control.


## Glossary

We use the following emojis as shorthands to make it easier to view or opinions on something at a glance.

| Emoji | Name          | Description                                                                            |
|-------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  üìâ   | Low pick rate | In the lower two thirds of pick rate according to [NightLight](https://nightlight.gg/) |
|  üò∑   | Unhealthy     | See definition under the [Methodology](#Methodology)                                   |
|  üí™   | Too strong    | Extremely powerful without a need for comboing                                         |
|  üóëÔ∏è   | Too weak      | Either overall low strength or outclassed by similar stronger elements                 |
|  üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë   | Abusable      | High potential to be abused in coordinated groups, particularly by high level players  |
|  üî¨   | Needs testing | Appreciable potential to be problematic (e.g. when comboed), requires playtesting      |
|  üí°   | Idea          | Just an early idea, not necessarily for implementation, and no balance promises        |
|  ‚è≤Ô∏è   | Incoming!     | A feature that has been officially roadmapped and concretely will be implemented soon  |


## Styling

In order to keep our changes as natural as possible, we do our best to format them familiarly. When describing an idea, we first try to mimic the official patch notes as much as possible (e.g. bolding numbers and their units and suffixing previous values in italics). Second we prioritize the [Wiki's style guide](https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki:Style_guide), which provides explicit rules and guidelines to enhance consistency. Finally, we do our best to keep things consistent outside of the aforementioned wherever applicable.

Let's use an example from a recent patch to demonstrate. If we want to lower the duration of insidious from it's previous 4/3/2 seconds to 3/2/1 seconds, the resulting change would be:
- Decreased the time it takes to activate to **3/2/1 second** *(was 4/3/2)*

Note there are two differences from the official patch notes here which are done for clarity:

1. We don't prefix every change with that element's name (e.g. Insidious: is not on the line above that change), instead we use markdown headings for ease of viewing.

2. We do not suffix changes with punctuation in-line, instead reserving end of line punctuation for sub-bullet notes. This makes it easier to identify that our notes are not the theoretical "patch notes".
